## Git Commands Used

| Command | Description |
|---------|------------|
| `git init` | Initializes a new Git repository in the project directory |
| `git remote -v` | Displays the current remote repository URL(s) |
| `git remote add origin <URL>` | Adds a remote repository URL |
| `git commit -m "message"` | Commits changes with a message |
| `git push -u origin main` | Pushes commits to the main branch of the remote repository |

## **Local Git Workflow vs GitHub Workflow**

| Aspect | Local Git Workflow | GitHub Workflow |
|--------|--------------------|----------------|
| Version Control | Manages versions locally | Manages versions in a remote repository |
| Collaboration | Limited to local machine | Enables team collaboration |
| Backup | No automatic backup | Cloud-based backup on GitHub |
| Accessibility | Available only on the local system | Accessible from anywhere |

---

## Challenges Faced
- **Remote Repository URL Issues:** Incorrectly configured remote repository led to errors while pushing.
- **Branch Issues:** The default branch was `master`, while GitHub expected `main`.
- **Authentication Problems:** Git required authentication using a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of passwords.

---

## When I Decided to Make a Commit
I made commits whenever a significant change was completed, such as:
- After initializing the repository.
- After configuring the remote repository.
- After resolving authentication errors.

---

## Benefits of AI Assistance
I used AI to:
- Troubleshoot Git errors efficiently.
- Understand the difference between `main` and `master` branches.
- Get help on configuring authentication methods.

## My Question and What I Learned
### **My Question:**
I encountered an error while trying to push my repository to GitHub. The error message was:

### **Platform Used:**
I used ChatGPT to debug and resolve my issue.

### **What I Learned:**
- How to correctly set up a GitHub remote repository.
- The importance of checking the correct repository URL.
- The difference between `master` and `main` branches in modern Git workflows.
- How to authenticate using a GitHub Personal Access Token.
